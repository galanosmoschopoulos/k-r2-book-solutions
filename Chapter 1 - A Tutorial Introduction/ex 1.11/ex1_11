1) If the amount of input text is extremely large, it would leed to an integer overflow of the variable nc, and maybe the variables nw and nl.
2) If the input text contains non english characters, such as the greek "Î±", the character counter produces a wrong result.
3) If the input text is only newlines, the character counter is wrong ("\n" should not be considered as a text character under normal -non programming- conditions).
