# K&R2  Book Solutions

*Contains my attempts to solve the exercises of the book "The C Programming Language 2nd Edition" by Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan.*

### Are the exercises solved perfectly?

By no means are the exercises solved the best and the most efficient way possible. There are surely better and more effective solutions that require less code and that use more intuitive algorithms to achieve the needed results. However, my solutions work just fine and are written with the book's proposed best practises.

### Which tools where used to solve the exercises?

To write, compile and run the exercises I used the following pieces of software:
- Text editor: Vim
- C compiler: GNU Compiler Collection / GCC (version 10)
- Operating system: GNU/Linux (Arch Linux)
